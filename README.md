# Solve 8 puzzle in several ways
Solve 8 puzzle by breadth-first search, depth-first serach, lower-bound search.

# Breadth-first search (bfs.py)
Considered the cost of each step is 1.

# Depth-first serach (dfs.py)
Limited the depth considering the maximum number of moves is 31.

# Lower-bound search(lower_bound.py)
Use Manhattan distance and limit the depth.

# example.py
You look at example.py and will know how to use this program.
